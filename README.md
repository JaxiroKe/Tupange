# Tupange
A library of puzzles of planets, countries, people, animals, vehicles and so much more. You are supposed to select the puzzle category you want to try and the app will randomly give you a puzzle in that category. Once you tap Start the puzzle is mixed up for you to rearrange well. The time and number of moves it takes to finish is what matters although you can use auto solve.
